1,Who is Gwyn Morgan?,"Former fossil fuels executive <a href=""https://www.desmog.com/gwyn-morgan/"">Gwyn Morgan</a> has been quietly backing a network of Canadian think tanks, astroturf groups and rightwing media disputing the climate crisis.
",,,,,
2,Donor to Atlas Network,"The <a href=""https://www.desmog.com/gwyn-morgan-and-patricia-trottier-foundation/"">Gwyn Morgan and Patricia Trottier Foundation</a> has donated millions of dollars to Canadian think tanks affiliated with the <a href=""https://www.desmog.com/atlas-economic-research-foundation/"">Atlas Network</a>, a powerful international organization that counts 500 ""free market"", anti-regulation member groups around the world.

Atlas's international network generates and promotes PR denying climate science and advocating for corporate-friendly policies, all while accepting donations from large international corporations.",,,,,
3,Member of Original Atlas Network Think Tank,"Morgan has been a member of the first Atlas Network group, the <a href=""https://www.desmog.com/fraser-institute/"">Fraser Institute</a>, <a href=""https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/fi-2023-annual-report_1.pdf"">as recently as 2023</a>. 

Fraser advocates against climate regulations while receiving money from oil companies like <a href=""https://deepclimate.org/2012/05/17/fraser-vs-pembina-part-2-funding/"">Encana/Ovintiv (founded by Morgan) and Imperial Oil's parent company ExxonMobil</a>, as well as right-wing American donor groups like the <a href=""https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/fi-2024-annual-report_0.pdf"">Koch, Scaife and Templeton Foundations</a>.",,,,,
4,Bankrolls Far-Right Media,"DeSmog revealed that Morgan donated almost a million dollars to True North/Juno News, a far-right, <a href=""https://pressprogress.ca/shopify-executives-right-wing-media-website-rails-against-immigrants-while-defending-a-legally-designated-terrorist-group/"">hate group supporting</a>, <a href=""https://tnc.news/2024/01/22/rhf-arsonists-fire-climate/"">climate denialist</a> Canadian media organization that has been registered as a charity. 

True North is run by former Alberta provincial conservative and Manning Centre staffers.",,,,,
5,Longtime Supporter of Canada Strong and Free Network,"Morgan has also been a large donor and partner to another key Canadian Atlas Network group, the conservative <a href=""https://www.desmog.com/canada-strong-and-free-network/"">Canada Strong and Free Network</a> (formerly the Manning Centre). 

CSFN platforms the same climate deniers and climate denial arguments as other Atlas Network groups, while being supported financially by large oil and gas companies.",,,,,
6,"Money Goes to ""Grassroots"" Conservative Campaign Advertising","Canada Strong and Free Network has given money to a similarly named group, Canada Strong and Proud, registered as a third-party-advertiser by the CFO of the <a href=""https://www.desmog.com/modern-miracle-network/"">Modern Miracle Network</a>. MMN's CEO, Michael Binnion, is the chair of Canada Strong and Free Network and has publicly asked oil and gas companies to fund CSFN through MMN. 

Canada Strong and Proud is connected to <a href=""https://www.desmog.com/canada-proud/"">Jeff Ballingall and his Canada Proud organizations</a>. The layers of similarly named organizations is likely meant to obfuscate that these so-called ""grassroots"" groups were paid for by rich individuals.",,,,,

His writing suggests his right-wing views go far beyond economic libertarianism. A recent Financial Post article featured the subtitle, <a href=""https://financialpost.com/opinion/gwyn-morgan-we-should-learn-from-germanys-mistakes"">""Ditching nuclear power in exchange for Russian gas was a big unforced policy error and so was essentially unlimited refugee immigration""</a>.
",,,,,
8,Joins with CEOs to Advertise for Pierre Poilievre,"During the 2025 election, Morgan and 32 other powerful business leaders paid for <a href=""https://torontosun.com/news/national/federal_elections/business-titans-take-out-ad-backing-poilievre-and-conservatives"">ads in traditional Canadian media outlets advocating for Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party of Canada</a>. 

Amongst the signers are CEOs for the most powerful oil companies in Canada. ",,,,,
